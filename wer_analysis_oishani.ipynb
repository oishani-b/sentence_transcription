    "WER top and bottom in the CSV contain the files with WER run on the preprocessed sentences. The dictionary for complete vocabulary has not yet been added to the WER script, and is being added to. First, we'll load in those CSV files, concatenate them together to get the original wer df back, and then analyse any high WER sentences to see what the transcriptions got us. We'll likely drop them currently for the sake of some analyses."
